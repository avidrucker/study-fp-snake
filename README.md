# Snake in FP Style TS

This project is inspired by [YouTube: JavaScript Snake Game Tutorial Using Functional Programming](https://youtu.be/bRlvGoWz6Ig) published on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube page and created by Christopher Okhravi.

My intention in creating this TypeScript port, I can make clear a concise, practical approach to building such a project as this from the ground up.
